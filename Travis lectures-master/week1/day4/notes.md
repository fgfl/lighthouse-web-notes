# Values
Yesterday you looked at variables by value vs by reference. 
How are functions stored?

We have been creating and using functions
```javascript
//create a function
function howdy(){
  console.log("hows it going?");
}
//use it
howdy();
```
But functions are a value as well, the value of the function itself can also be accessed with.
```javascript
howdy;
```

# Anonymous function

It is also possible in JavaScript to create a function without a name. 

```javascript
function(){
  console.log("you can't call me");
}
```
This is known as an anonymous function. 
Because it has no name we don't have a way to call the function in the above example. 

We can however give an anonymous function a name so we can use it. 

# Functional Expression vs Declaration
You can create a function as a declaration or as an expression.

A functional declaration is:
```javascript
function howdy(){
  console.log("hey there pardner");
}
```
With a functional expression we assign a name to an anonymous function:

```javascript
const howdy = function(){
  console.log("hey there pardner");
}
```
In both cases you can access the function by the name __howdy__ and call the function with __howdy()__

The is one difference between function declarations and function expressions is...

>Functional expressions don't get hoisted.

  Meaning you cannot call a functional expression before it is declared. 

```javascript
howdy(); //valid
function howdy(){
  console.log("hey there pardner");
}
```

```javascript
howdy(); //not valid
const howdy = function(){
  console.log("hey there pardner");
}
```


Why they exist
Implementing our own forEach and/or our own filter

Arrow Functions (and their common use for callback functions)
Nested scope and "scope chainy"
Teacher Notes
sync functions such as Array.map.

Functions as callbacks
Talk about callbacks and functions that take callbacks.

An example narrative of taking code that does two things, and splitting it into two single-purpose functions.

const array = [1, 2, 3];
for (const item of items) {
  console.log(item);
};

// can be rewritten as:

const logEach = function(items) {
  for (const item of items) {
    console.log(item);
  }
};

// but if we want something more abstract and single-purpose

const forEach = function(items, action) {
  for (const item of items) {
    action(item);
  }
};
forEach is therefore a Higher-Order function. Talk about how Array has forEach built in which does exactly that.


Mention to students that while it's nice to be able to label things, remembering keywords / buzz words like "Higher-Order Function" is not the most important part.

Arrow Functions
Today students get introduced to Arrow functions. Feel free to introduce and use them part way through lecture.

Exercise (live-code)
Live code a forEachInReverse that does reverse iteration on an array and takes a cb much like forEach would.

const forEachInReverse = function(items, func) {
  for (let i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    func(items[i]);
  }
};

forEachInReverse(['hello', 'Lighthouse Labs', 'and', 'world'], (word) => {
  console.log(word);
});
Once implemented, add a second parameter to the callback to support index passing (i).

const forEachInReverse = function(items, func) {
  for (let i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    func(items[i], i);
  }
};

forEachInReverse(['hello', 'lighthouse labs', 'and', 'world'], (word, index) => {
  console.log(`The word at index ${index} is "${word}"`);
});
Important scope review: talk about the two different i vars there. Change one of them to demo how they don't need to be the same variable name.

Why write Higher-order functions? What's the rationale?

Important to explain and emphasize Single Responsibility Principle:

These two functions (the callback vs the higher-order function) now each have a single, more concise responsibility, instead of doing both things. This is the most important reason for creating HO functions.

A function should have a sole reason to exist, and delegate other responsibilities to other functions as needed.

Scope chain (nested scope)
Technical definition (taken from this popular resource):

To put it simply, each time you attempt to access a variable within a functionâ€™s execution context, the look-up process will always begin with its own variable object. If the identifier is not found in the variable object, the search continues into the scope chain. It will climb up the scope chain examining the variable object of every execution context looking for a match to the variable name.

The example there is good enough. Roll with it or roll your own.

TIP: Tech jargon isn't the main focus here. Most experienced devs don't even know the difference between "Context" (this), "Execution Context", and "Variable Object".

Out Of Scope
Closures (this used to be core, but is now stretch for today)
Asynchronous Control Flow or Functions (like setTimeout, etc.)
Arrow functions and this (there is mention of this today, but you don't need to emphasize it now)
