## Review  üì¢

so far we have stored data with javascript objects as in tinyappüë∂.
but there were a few problems with this approach.

- there was no data persistence,
 when the app was restarted any url or new user we added would not be saved
- Data could become disorganized, and there was nothing ensuring it was stored with the correct format.
- Could add poorly formatted data to the object

---

We want a SPECIFIC STRUCTURE TO OUR DATA.

So....

---

# Relational Database

![Tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week4/Day1/Lecture/assets/table.gif)

A database that stores information in tables where each
individual thing or entry in the db takes up a row of the table
each table can have relationships to other tables.

relations are what allow us to organize our data in intuitive ways.

---

## Relational Database Management Systems

Is the implementation of a relational database.
It allows you to create databases and manage your data. examples are mySQL, Oracle, postgresql, ...

# The Landscape üñº

There are many RDBMS (different vendors. open vs closed source)
Oracle, Microsoft SQL server || Postgres, MySQL, SQLlite

In the bootcamp we will be using Postgresql

Why Postgres? (why not MySQL?)
- open source
- highly extendable
- handles concurrency well
- Industry relevance

SQLite is a server-less database and is self-contained. This is also referred to as an embedded database. It is lightweight(250kb vs 600mb) and portable but less flexible and scalable (only one user can write at a time)

You will be using SQLlite for the test this week. 

---

# SQL (structured query language)

![SQL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week4/Day1/Lecture/assets/sql.png)

- language that allows us look for (query) and insert data into an sql database
- almost all relational databases use SQL.
- SQL is not like other programming languages we have learned so far.
- It is a query language specifically for data
- You can't write programs in sql

DDL(Data Definition Language) : DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in the database.
Examples of DDL commands: (CREATE, DROP)

DQL(Data Query Language) Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it.

Example of DQL: (SELECT)

DML(Data Manipulation Language) : The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements.
Examples of DML: (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

---

## PSQL

Interactive terminal database client that allows us to connect and interact with POSTGRESQL database with sql commands.

---

## Creating a Table

![Tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week4/Day1/Lecture/assets/table.jpeg)

We can send commands to the database to create a table. When creating a table we provide the types and constraints to the named columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE albums (
 id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
 title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
 year INTEGER NOT NULL,
 artist_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

---

## Schema üìë

The skeletal structure representing how data is to be stored in a database.
Specifies Constraints on the data.

\d <table name>

---

## Indexes üëÜ
A unique identifier that improves the speed of data fetches.

---

## Data Types üìö

When defining columns for the tables you will need to specify the data type. `INTEGER, VARCHAR, TEXT, BOOLEAN, DATE` are common examples.

- Primary key column. Use the name `id` and then `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL`.
- Names, emails, usernames and passwords can all be stored as `VARCHAR(255)`.
- Foreign key columns. Add `_id` to the singular name of the column you are referencing. Artists to albums would be `album_id`. The type would be `INTEGER` but you also should create the foreign key with `REFERENCES albums(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- Dates would use the `DATE` type. If you needed [date and time](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-datetime.html) you would use `TIMESTAMP`.

You will use `INTEGER` to represent most [numbers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-numeric.html). There are other *sizes* of integers as well.

- __SMALLINT__ -32,768 to 32,767 (thirty-two thousand)
- __INTEGER__ -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (two billion)
- __BIGINT__ -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (nine quintillion)
- __SERIAL__ 1 to 2,147,483,647 (auto incrementing)

---


## FOREIGN KEYS ü§ñ üîë

With relational databases relationships are made with foreign keys.
The relationship links one tables entry with other table entries.
The Types of relationships are..

 - one to one
 - many to one

The table with the foreign key is known as the child and the table referenced by the FK is known as the parent. 


- Foreign key columns. Add `_id` to the singular name of the column you are referencing. Albums to artists would be `artist_id`. The type would be `INTEGER` but you also should create the foreign key with `REFERENCES artists(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.

---

## CREATE/INSERT

Before we can search for data we need to add it. In order to create records in a table we use the [INSERT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-insert.html) command.

```sql
INSERT INTO "artists" (id, name)
VALUES(1, 'Name');

INSERT INTO "albums" (
 id,
 title,
 year,
 artist_id
) VALUES(
 1,
 'The Earth is not a Cold Dead Place',
 2003,
 1
);
```

If you need to insert multiple records at the same time a single query is quicker than many. It is important to do as few queries as possible to keep performance high.

*

```sql
INSERT INTO "tracks" (title, number, album_id) VALUES
('First Breath After Coma', 1, 1),
('First Breath After Coma', 2, 1),
('First Breath After Coma', 3, 1),
('First Breath After Coma', 4, 1);
```

---


## SELECT

The selection of data is likely to cause the most confusion for you. There are 6 different clauses that you would use to query for data.

- __SELECT__ - List the columns and aggregate data you are interested in.
- __FROM__ - Provide one or more tables that you want data from.
- __WHERE__ - Only select records that match a condition.
- __GROUP BY__ - Combine the results based on a column so an aggregate can be applied to each group.
- __HAVING__ - Only select the results that match a condition.
- __ORDER BY__ - Describe the parameters for the results ordering.

### üíΩ I want the name and id of all artists.

*
```
//This will display the name and id columns from the
//artists table.
```

```sql
SELECT name, id FROM artists;
```
*  

---    

### üíΩ I want to see Daft Punk's albums.

*  
```  
//This will display all columns for albums
//where artist_id = the given number
```

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM albums
WHERE artist_id = ?;
```  
*  

---  

### üíΩ I want all the title and track number of all songs of Discovery.  

*  
```
//This will display the title and  track nubmer
// for tracks where album_id = given number
```

```sql
SELECT title, number as track_number
FROM tracks
WHERE album_id = ?;
```  
*  

---  

### üíΩ I want the name and year each album was released ordered by year.

*  
```
//This will display the name and year columns from the
//albumns table.
```

```sql
SELECT name, year 
FROM albums
ORDER BY year;
```
*  

---  

### üíΩ I want to see how many tracks there are.

*  
```
//This will display the number of rows, which represents
//the number of tracks.
```

```sql
SELECT count(id) FROM tracks;
```  
*  

---  

### üíΩ I want to see how many tracks there are for a specific album

*  
```  
// This will display the count for all the rows matching
// the condition of the artist being id 1.
// With the AS clause we can alias the column name to
// give us more descriptive results.
```

```sql
SELECT count(id) AS tracks_count
FROM tracks
WHERE albumn_id = 1;
```
*  

---  

### üíΩ I want the title of all albums released by Kanye West and the name of the first track on the album.

Problem?

The artist information is stored in a separate table

---  

## JOIN ü§ù

![Joins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week4/Day1/Lecture/assets/joins.jpeg)

There are 5 kinds of joins.

- `INNER JOIN` is the same as `JOIN`
- `LEFT OUTER JOIN` is the same as `LEFT JOIN`
- `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` is the same as `RIGHT JOIN`
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` is the same as `OUTER JOIN`
- `CROSS JOIN`

---  

When performing a `JOIN` you define the type of join, the two tables involved in the operation and the condition that is used to join on.

```sql
SELECT * FROM T1 JOIN T2 ON <condition>;
```

In this example `T1` is the table on the `LEFT` of the join and `T2` is on the `RIGHT`. This becomes important when working with `LEFT/RIGHT JOIN`.

---

When we start joining tables we need to be unambiguous. We will target columns by table.column naming.

- `track.id`
- `track.name`
- `albumn.name`

[Queries with FROM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-FROM)

---


### INNER JOIN

With an `INNER JOIN` only rows where the `ON` condition is met are included in the results.

```sql
INSERT INTO "artists" (id, name)
VALUES(123, 'Neezy Boscareezy');
```


```sql
SELECT artist.id, artist.name AS artist_name,
album.title AS albumn_title
FROM artists
INNER JOIN albums
ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;
```

Notice that the `artists.id = albums.artist_id` condition was not satisfied for the up and coming artist "Neezy Boscareezy" because he has not yet dropped his mixtape üíæ üî•üî•üî•.

---


### OUTER JOINS

The `OUTER JOIN` requires us to specify whether it is the `LEFT` or `RIGHT` table that is used to provide unmatched rows. For any row where the condition was not met a row is added with null for columns from the second table.

```sql
SELECT artist.id, artist.name AS artist_name, album.title AS albumn_title
FROM artists
LEFT OUTER JOIN albums
ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;

```

Since this was a `LEFT JOIN` after all the rows are matched the remaining ones are appended, and we can see out boi Neezy.

---

__RIGHT OUTER JOIN__

This is an uncommon join. Since we have to specify the side to join on we have two options. In the above example the albumns table is on the right side of the join. If we turn this into a `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` then we get different results back.

```sql
SELECT artists.id, artists.name AS artist_name, album.title AS albumn_title
FROM artists
RIGHT OUTER JOIN albums
ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;

```

If we wanted the same results as above with a `RIGHT JOIN` then we would need to alter the query to put the artists table on the right side of the join.

```sql
SELECT artists.id, artists.name AS artist_name, album.title AS albumn_title
FROM albums
RIGHT OUTER JOIN artists
ON artists.id = albums.artist_id;
```

---

### CROSS JOIN

Using a `CROSS JOIN` we can get the cartesian product. A row for every artist and a row for every album. This isn't very useful and is only provided for completeness.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM artists
CROSS JOIN albums;
```

Which achieves the same result set as:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM artists, albums;
```

Adding a where clause to filter out the duplicate results acts just like an `INNER JOIN`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM artists, albums
WHERE artists.id = albums.artists_id;
```

---

## UPDATE & DELETE

These queries seem to be a lot simpler than ones that begin with `SELECT`. BUT The `UPDATE` and `DELETE` are the most dangerous queries because they change or remove data. This means you need to be very careful when using either of them. Never write an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` query without a `WHERE` clause. Why?

The key takeaway is to be extra careful working on production databases. Test all your update and delete operations on a development database.

---

[UPDATE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-update.html)

Let's say that a artist has changed their stage name part way through their career. We could update their name with.

```sql
UPDATE artists
SET name='Boscareezy'
WHERE id = 123;
```

---

[DELETE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-delete.html)

If you want to delete a specific row you specify a `WHERE` clause. Deleting data should be avoided if possible. 

```sql
DELETE FROM artists WHERE id = 3;
```

Some people prefer to have a `deleted_at` column that stores a DATE. That way you can still filter out deleted results without having to lose the data. Storage is not expensive.

You've seen a reference to `ON DELETE CASCADE` for foreign key references. If we delete an artist then we may want to delete all of the albums that point to the record. The cascading delete functionality is a [constraint](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html). It is not necessary to use CASCADE. If you don't you may notice some issues when trying to delete something that has a foreign reference to it.


## Group By & Aggregates üìä

Aggregate functions allow you to perform calculations on groups of data in a query. 
An aggregate function returns a single scalar value.
Are often used with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

The following are the most commonly used SQL aggregate functions:

- AVG ‚Äì calculates the average of a set of values.
- COUNT ‚Äì counts rows in a specified table or view.
- MIN ‚Äì gets the minimum value in a set of values.
- MAX ‚Äì gets the maximum value in a set of values.
- SUM ‚Äì calculates the sum of values.

```sql
SELECT album_id, count(id) AS track_count
FROM tracks
GROUP BY album_id;
```

### GROUP BY ü§π

Groups rows that have the same value into summary rows.
Squishes common rows into one.

Aggregate functions look at the individual rows before they are squished.


### HAVING ü§ó

Functions the same as a WHERE clause, but is used after the rows are grouped.

WHERE filters the rows before they are grouped.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition;
```

# GROUP BY and SELECT ü§π   

If we are using GROUP BY...
Anything we specify in a SELECT must appear in the the GROUP BY
or must be an aggregate function.

```
id  |                  title                  | number | album_id

## IN operator üì•

Allows you to match values from an array or a group of values


```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
```
