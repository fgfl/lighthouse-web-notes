# W7D1 Component-Based UI w/ React

### To Do
- [x] What the heck is React?
- [x] Components
- [x] Building a project from scratch w React (using Storybook)
- [x] Combining components together

### React
- From the landing page of [React](https://reactjs.org/):
  > A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Open source project maintained by Facebook
- React is built around the concept of managing data
  - Changes to the underlying data result in changes to the UI
  - In React, state === data
- Component-based: UI is composed of small pieces
- Declarative: We describe the final outcome of our code and not the step-by-step process to achieve that result

### Components
- Components are the building blocks of a webpage (eg. search input, navigation bar, contact us form)
- Ideally, components should be reusable (which means that their state should be passed into them via props rather than maintaining their own state)
- Deciding what which DOM elements become components and which don't is a skill that comes with practice and experience
- We will be building all of our components using functions
