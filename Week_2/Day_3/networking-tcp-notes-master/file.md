To note! The string must be taut for the signal to go through.

### Basic usage

- Requires two human beings.
- Each human takes a can.
- Tin can phone is for TALKING as well as LISTENING.
- TALK: To talk, place mouth at edge of can and shout
- LISTEN: To hear, place ear at edge of can and listen
- Note! It is physically impossible to talk and listen at the same time.

### Conversation Flow

1. The two agents (A, B) both enter the system
2. Each agent immediately LISTEN perpetually

An option:

3. When an agent wants to send a message, they perform TALK
    - Note!!! The other agent may talk at the same time, in which case neither message will actually be received

Option:
- send a signal when you want to talk (Roger, Roger)
    - wait for acknowledgement
        - if received, talk
        - if not received, try again
- addition: send a signal when you're done talking
- when you receive a request to talk , send back an acknowledgement

### Handling Sessions

- how to handle when someone loggs off?
- how to handle stormy conditions


- how to handle multiple people using the tin can phone
Options:
- each person has a code
    - an agent may give their code when they hop on
    - an agent MAY give their code at the beginning of every message


A ------ B (talk for one minute)
C ------ D (talk for one minute)
E ------ F (talk for one minute)

loop!

- wait. deal with it.
- time division!! is also a choice
