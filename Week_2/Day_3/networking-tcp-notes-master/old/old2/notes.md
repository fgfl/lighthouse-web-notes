Thanks for sitting in on today's lecture! Here are the notes we wrote in class. Sorry for not formatting them or adding more info! Check out previous lecture notes for more content.

TCP/IP + Networking

## Networking

1. Firm handshake
2. State your name
3. Say why you're there
4. Talk out of turn --- don't do this!

Prtocols!

HTTP TCP WebSockets TCP/IP Telnet

## Networking in Tech!

Communicating with other machines or people!

- ears: receiving communication
- your mouth: emitting communication
- location: context through the location that we're in
- who am i communicating with?

- AIR could totally be a mediumn
- wire
- light


Agent A ðŸ¥«----------ðŸ¥« Agent B

Immediate questsion?
- how many people can be connected?
- how many people can INPUT at a time?

Medium itself
- has some baggage!
- e.g. tin can phone can only stretch so far
- might be pretty low-quality, which means that we might have to send messages more than once

How to use the medium
- comes out of the issues that the medium itself presents



OSI !== ISO



## Tin Can Phone Protocol: TCPP

### What is it physically?

Physically, the tin can phone is a pair of tin cans (often tomato sauce) connected by a wire. Copper wire.

## How can one use it?

Agent one can shout into it while agent two is listening, and vice versa. Ideally, there shouldn't be two-way communication simultaneously, otherwise we might have clashing messages.

## Implementation of single-actor speaking

1. Maybe have a codeword to indicate that you are done talking
2. A codeword to say that you are about to start talking

1. Have patterns for when you're allowed to communicate (time slicing)

## Higher Order (Abstract) Rules

What are we going to talk about?

- Hey are you free?
- Can I have some money?
- Are you interested in making money from your own home?
- Give me a resource
    - image
    - some text
    - the status of something

- Hey can I have the salt ---> nah!
- Ayo hit that boi up the salt


==========

- physical stuff
- transportation of messages
- what kind of messages can you make

## TCP, IP, and HTTP

- IP: a highway between computers
  - how you use the physical stuff
- TCP: the trucks on the highway going to find a particular computer
- HTTP: is the load on the trucks
