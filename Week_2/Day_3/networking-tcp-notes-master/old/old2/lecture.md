# Week 2 Day 3: Networking, TCP, little bit of HTTP

What is networking? - Review
TCP intro
- demo

What is networking?

- communication
- communication between two systems, computers, agents/actors
- facilitates transfer of information

- A has something
- B wants it
- A gives it to B

- medium through which the communication can happen

radio
wifi
physical cable
copper wire

A ----------- B

Tin can telephone

Bradlina
Kristoferetta

Rules:

1. We only talk one at a time
2. Say "over" when you're done talking
3. Make sure no one else is talking by listening before you speak

4. Bradlina can only talk during EVEN minutes
5. Kristoferetta can only talk during ODD minutes

Trasport Control Protocol

TCP

YOU CAN SEND MESSAGES TO SOEMONE
YOU CAN RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM SOMEONE

-- as long as you have a "connection"

- server
- client



TCP

- protocol that allows us to transfer data safely

IP

- highway to allow other protocols to get on and find their way to computers.

- ANY kind of messages (trucks on the highway)
    - big semi
    - some kid on a moped

TCP

- very reliable truck that allows messages to to drive on the "IP" highway

HTTP

- the stuff that the truck carries

The "STACK"

SERVERS
- the provider
- can receive requests
- can process requests
- send out information

CLIENTS
- someone who asks for something
- send messages to the server

MAKE REQUESTS as a client
LISTENS FOR REQUESTS -> server
SERVER replies


localhost:1337/users

I WANT TO GET THE...
