- point of bootcamp is to get you to be a competent junior developer, get a job

## Dev Workflow

### Tips
- Drink water
- ask for help after 15 mins
- take an acive role in mentorship. stop mentors early if you start getting it to try yourself.
- make your code transparent.

### Where to look for help
- google
- stack overflow
- documentations
  - NodeJS docs
  - MDN docs
- blog posts(generally trash)
- Youtube videos (don't bother)
  - if its' for small stuff

### problem solving

Problem
===
- split the probelm into steps
- often there are examples. Take a look at them
- come up with your own examples to really understand it

1. Write a node program that
2. takes in an unlimited number of commandl ine arguments,
  - *what if I didn't though?* start with 1, 2, 3, then unlimited
3. goes through each
4. and prints out the sum of them.
If any arguments is not a whole number, skip it.
Do support negative numbers though.


Input:
`node sum.js 1 2 3 4`
`node sum.js 1 1 1 1 -1`
`node sum.js 4 5 0.2`

Output:
`10`
`3`
`9`

Nima's examples
Input:
`node sum.js

## Incremental Programming
Rinse and repeat forever:
1. make hypothesis
2. test hypotesis
3. make small changes
